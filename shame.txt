OperationalError at /admin/base/testimony/add/
no such table: base_testimony

fix: i had to add the app name when migrating. 'python manage.py makemigrations base' 'python manage.py migrate base'


-couldn't make bg images with admin so i used [image var].[class attribute var].url   so it was bg.image.url
look at the views and the models and it'll make sense
